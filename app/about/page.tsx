        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Wanjiku Elijah’s Homecoming Ceremony</strong> is rooted in the rich cultural traditions of the Kikuyu community. The event, known as <em>Kamweretho</em> in Nyeri, honors parents and reconnects generations in a deeply meaningful way.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          In Kikuyu tradition, married daughters become part of their husbands lineage and are not typically considered heirs of their own parents property. However, daughters who remain unmarried or are single parents may inherit equally alongside their brothers.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Kamweretho</strong> ceremonies are organized by daughters to appreciate and celebrate their upbringing. In regions like Nyeri, this tradition is embraced, while in others like Kiambu and Murang’a—where PCEA Church influence is strong—it has been met with opposition. Nonetheless, many still honor the practice as a vital expression of cultural identity.
